Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Tone.js for every sound features. 

## Goal 

The goal of this project is to help endeveaoured musicians to enhance their musical earing ability through mini-games and challenges. 

## Web interfafce 

The front is made so that we can switch from mini-games or challenges without having to load new pages. It was a choice made in reference to old flash games that we could find online, where the game was placed in the middle of the web page, surounded by loads of information. 

For now the challenge presented in the web page is a local challenge, that a user can only play with itself. But the ultimate goal,  with which this project is coded along, is to transform this challenge into a multi-player one.
