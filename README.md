## Goal 

The goal of this project is to help endeveaoured musicians to enhance their musical earing ability through mini-games and challenges. 

## Web interfafce 

The front is made so that we can switch from mini-games or challenges without having to load new pages. It was a choice made in reference to old flash games that we could find online, where the game was placed in the middle of the web page, surounded by loads of information. 

For now the challenge presented in the web page is a local challenge, that a user can only play with itself. But the ultimate goal,  with which this project is coded along, is to transform this challenge into a multi-player one. 

## Mini-game 1 

Help tabloid musicians learn how to read a musical sheet (at least in a G clef). All the images are loaded from the directory /img. 

## Mini-game 2 

In this game, we work on the relative earing. We start from a note, which can be discover with the Tip button, and regarding the mode that you have selected, a specific progression of 4 other notes will appear. The goal here is to map the notes that you feel perceiving onto the musical sheet. Specificities of each mode are written on the page. 

## Challenge 

Last but not least, the challenge. Based on the second mini-game, its aim here is to help you verify that you ear is well trained. 5 random notes are played and the goal is to guess them. You have three attempts and 5 sequences in total. The goal is to have the most points at the end of the playing of the five sequences of notes.
